This repository is for Quantum Fourier Transforms, my final project for PHYSICS 14N Winter 2021.

Key points:
The .ipynb notebook has everything needed to run the code and see the results; it also includes complete documentation (line-by-line) and big picture to keep track of overall structure, specific equations that are applied, and comparison of the results to expectations.

There are also additional image files in case you would like to see the expected results, generated in a "hard-coded" manner (foolproof) by running Qiskit's statevector simulator on the Bloch sphere.
There are files to see "14" in the computational and Fourier bases, and "2" in the computational and Fourier bases - these are the 2 examples I use for the QFT and inverse QFT demos respectively.

To gain a better understanding of QFTs more conceptually, please read my article on the same topic (also in this repository as a PDF).

Thank you for reading!
